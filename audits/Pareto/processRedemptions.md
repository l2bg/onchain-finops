# Audit: `processRedemptions(uint256 maxUsers)`

**Contract:** `ParetoDollarQueue.sol`  
**Function Purpose:** Executes queued redemptions of USP token for users who submitted a request.

---

## High-Level Overview

This function processes redemption requests by looping through a queue of users and transferring their owed USP. While it performs its job, its current 
structure introduces major gas inefficiencies:

- Burn gas as the queue grows
- Leave stale users in the queue forever
- Cause long-term, protocol-paid gas bloat

## Source Code (Original)

```solidity
function processRedemptions(uint256 maxUsers) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    // Load the current total length of the redemptionQueue array
    // Gas: 1x SLOAD of array length (~100 gas)
    uint256 len = redemptionQueue.length;

    // Counter to track how many users we've processed in this call
    uint256 processed = 0;

    // Loop from i = 0 up to len (entire array), capped by maxUsers
    // Major issue: always starts from index 0 every time function is called
    // This causes unnecessary re-processing of stale users whoâ€™ve already redeemed or never had a balance
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < len && processed < maxUsers; i++) {

        // Load the address of the user at position i in the queue
        // Gas: SLOAD of redemptionQueue[i] (~2,100 gas)
        address user = redemptionQueue[i];

        // Fetch the redemption amount owed to this user
        // Gas: SLOAD from mapping pendingRedemption[user] (~2,100 gas)
        uint256 amount = pendingRedemption[user];

        // If the amount is zero, skip to next iteration
        // Problem: this user remains in the queue and will be reprocessed again in future calls
        if (amount == 0) {
            continue;
        }

        // Burn the USP tokens held by the contract before transferring
        // Gas: External call â€” typically 15k to 25k+ gas depending on token logic
        uspToken.burn(address(this), amount);

        // Send the USP tokens to the user
        // Gas: External call â€” 10k to 20k+ depending on token implementation
        uspToken.transfer(user, amount);

        // Reset this user's pending redemption to zero
        // Gas: SSTORE â€” if resetting from non-zero to zero, costs 5,000 gas (may refund 15k in some scenarios)
        pendingRedemption[user] = 0;

        // Increment number of users processed in this call
        processed++;
    }
}
```
## Gas Cost Simulation Challenge
Say the queue has 10,000 entries but only 300 still need processing

If you call processRedemptions(100):

You scan 10,000 entries
Skip 9,900 zombies
Pay SLOAD and loop cost for each

Estimated waste:

9,900 Ã— ~4,000 gas â‰ˆ 39.6M gas â‰ˆ ~$2,800+ per run
Monthly: $2,800 Ã— 30 = $84,000/month
Yearly: $84,000 x 12 = ~$1M in gas burned just from stale redemptions!

## Optimized Version

```solidity
// Add this as a new state variable to persist queue progress between calls
uint256 public nextRedemptionIndex;

function processRedemptions(uint256 maxUsers) external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    // Track how many users we've processed this run
    uint256 processed = 0;

    // Load total length of the redemption queue (unchanged)
    uint256 len = redemptionQueue.length;

    // ðŸš€ Optimization: Start from where we left off last time
    for (uint256 i = nextRedemptionIndex; i < len && processed < maxUsers; i++) {
        // Get the queued user
        address user = redemptionQueue[i];

        // Check how much they are owed
        uint256 amount = pendingRedemption[user];

        // Skip if there's nothing to redeem
        if (amount == 0) {
            continue;
        }

        // Burn the contract's token balance
        uspToken.burn(address(this), amount);

        // Transfer USP to user
        uspToken.transfer(user, amount);

        // Reset user redemption record
        pendingRedemption[user] = 0;

        // Increment counter
        processed++;

        // ðŸ”§ Track last index we processed
        nextRedemptionIndex = i + 1;
    }
}
```

## Comments

This function represents a major ongoing gas leak that scales with protocol usage.
With the solution presented above, the protocol could potentially:

Prevent reprocessing of thousands of inactive users
Cut keeper costs by thousands per call
Improve efficiency as protocol scales
