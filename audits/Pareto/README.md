# ParetoDollarQueue.sol Gas Optimization Audit

This folder contains a detailed gas cost audit of the `ParetoDollarQueue.sol` smart contract used in the Pareto protocol â€” a private credit DeFi platform offering 
synthetic stablecoin infrastructure.

## Objective

The goal of this audit is to identify and explain functions within the ParetoDollarQueue.sol contract that:

- Consume excessive gas under normal or high usage
- Impact protocol cost-efficiency, user experience, or scalability
- Can be significantly optimized without altering protocol logic

## Scope 

This audit focuses on two core high-frequency functions:

| Function | Description | Risk |
|----------|-------------|------|
| [`processRedemptions(uint256 maxUsers)`](./processRedemptions.md) | Executes queued redemptions, burning and transferring USP tokens | ðŸŸ¥ Protocol pays high gas due to unbounded stale queue |
| [`depositToVault()`](./depositToVault.md) | Iterates over userâ€™s vault queue and deposits funds | ðŸŸ§ User pays for stale or 0-value deposit entries |


## Structure

This folder includes:

- `processRedemptions.md` â€” Full breakdown of redemption queue inefficiency
- `depositToVault.md` â€” Audit of vault deposit iteration and cleanup
- `README.md` â€” You are here


Gas inefficiencies aren't cosmetic â€” they're financial liabilities.  Even minor logic errors in high-frequency functions can:

- Burn **hundreds of thousands of dollars** annually
- Degrade UX by making redemptions/deposits prohibitively expensive
- Reduce competitiveness vs. more gas-efficient DeFi protocols

This audit sets the foundation for fixing these issues and improving Paretoâ€™s long-term sustainability.

Future work may include:

- Foundry-based gas benchmarks 
- Pull request patches or optimization proposals (`/src/`)
- Optional expansion to other contracts like `ParetoDollar.sol` or `Staking`

## Contributions Welcome

If you'd like to improve this audit, add benchmark tests, or contribute optimization ideas â€” feel free to fork and open a PR.
